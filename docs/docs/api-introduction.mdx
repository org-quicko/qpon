# API Introduction

The Qpon API supports two authorization methods for authenticating your requests. Choose the method that best fits your use case.

## Authorization Methods

### 1. Bearer Token Authentication

This method uses JWT tokens obtained through the login endpoint. Include the token in the `Authorization` header.

**Usage:**
```http
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

**How to get a token:**
1. Call the `/api/users/login` endpoint with your email and password
2. Extract the `access_token` from the response
3. Use this token in subsequent API calls

### 2. API Key Authentication

This method uses API keys for programmatic access. Include both the API key and secret in the request headers.

**Usage:**
```http
x-api-key: <your-api-key>
x-api-secret: <your-api-secret>
```

**How to get API keys:**
1. Call the `/api/api-keys` endpoint to create an API key
2. Store the returned `api_key` and `api_secret` securely
3. Use these credentials in your API requests

## Choosing an Authorization Method

- **Bearer Token**: Best for user-facing applications where users log in with their credentials
- **API Key**: Best for server-to-server communication, integrations, and automated systems

## Security Notes

- Keep your tokens and API keys secure and never expose them in client-side code
- API keys should be rotated regularly for security
- Bearer tokens have expiration times and need to be refreshed
- Use HTTPS for all API requests to protect credentials in transit

## Error Responses

Both authorization methods return `401 Unauthorized` if:
- The token is invalid or expired
- The API key/secret combination is incorrect
- Required headers are missing

```json
{
  "code": 401,
  "message": "Unauthorized"
}
```
